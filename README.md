## Why?

Gists are nice, while there are wonderful forges like
[Gitea](https://gitea.io), there isn't a libre pastebin implementation that
can rival GitHub Gists.

## Usage

1. All configuration is done through
   [./config/default.toml](./config/default.toml)(can be moved to
   `/etc/static-gists/config.toml`).
